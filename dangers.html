    How does drinking affect an individual?

    <p class = "info">
        Drinking results in drastic effects on an individual. Excessive alcohol intakes can lead to drunkeness, which makes it very difficult for one to do basic tasks, often affecting their actions and words. A drunk person can become increasingly violent or aggressive, and may want to engage in dangerous activities. Drunk driving is one of the leading causes of car accidents in the world. Excessive drinking can also lead to health issues such as liver disease and alcohol intoxication, both diseases being serious and deadly. Drinking also causes financial issues for individuals who drink regularly.
